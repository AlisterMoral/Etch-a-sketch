# Etch-a-sketch

Started Etch a sketch project by creating a 16x16 square divs using the DOM and flexbox.

After this i setted up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them.

Created a button that send a pop up  asking for the number of squares per side for the grid up to 100 (the limite).

Then i finish by putting a random color button when you press it the hover event become random color 
and if you pass 10 time on the meme divs it become white
